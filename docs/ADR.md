  - Partition by date for performance
  - 100x cheaper than SQL Database

### Alternatives Considered
- **Cosmos DB:** Overkill and expensive (~$25/month minimum)
- **SQL Database:** Complex queries not needed, higher cost
- **Single Blob Storage:** Poor query performance for metadata

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Optimal performance per use case, cost efficient
- **Negative:** Dual storage complexity
- **Result:** Perfect for different access patterns

### Rationale
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets or connection strings in code
- **Azure Native:** Automatic credential rotation and management
- **Zero Configuration:** Built-in integration with Azure services
- **Audit Trail:** Complete access logging in Azure AD
- **Best Practice:** Microsoft's recommended security pattern

### Alternatives Considered
- **Service Principals:** Manual credential management
- **Connection Strings:** Security risk, manual rotation
- **API Keys:** Static credentials, exposure risk

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Maximum security, zero credential management
- **Negative:** Azure-specific, local development complexity
- **Resolution:** Fallback to connection strings for local development

## ADR-005: Repository Pattern for Data Access

**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Design data access layer that's testable, maintainable, and follows clean architecture principles.

### Decision
Implement Repository pattern with `ImageAnalysisRepository` class for all data operations.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic separated from data access
- **Testability:** Easy to mock for unit testing
- **Maintainability:** Single place for all storage operations
- **Flexibility:** Can switch storage implementations without affecting business logic
- **Error Handling:** Centralized exception handling

### Implementation
```python
class ImageAnalysisRepository:
    def save_analysis_result(self, image_id, blob_name, analysis_data, upload_time, file_metadata)
    def get_analysis_result(self, image_id)
    def get_results_by_date_range(self, start_date, end_date, max_results=50)
    def update_status(self, image_id, status)
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Clean architecture, testable code, maintainable
- **Negative:** Additional abstraction layer
- **Result:** Well-structured, professional codebase

## ADR-006: Date-Based Partitioning Strategy

**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Design Table Storage partitioning for optimal query performance and cost.

### Decision
Use date-based partitioning (YYYY-MM-DD) as PartitionKey with `imageId_timestamp` as RowKey.

### Rationale
- **Query Performance:** Most queries are recent data (last 7-30 days)
- **Even Distribution:** Prevents hot partitions
- **Cost Optimization:** Efficient range queries
- **Scalability:** Supports millions of records per day
- **Analytics Friendly:** Easy date-based aggregations

### Schema Design
```
PartitionKey: "2025-08-06" 
RowKey: "5fcfc5e4-8d61-4de0-a6c6-ffd77ef6453c_20250806_222052"
```

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Optimal performance for time-based queries
- **Negative:** Cross-partition queries for user-specific data
- **Acceptable Trade-off:** Most use cases are time-based analytics

- **Simplified Structure:** All functions in single `function_app.py`
- **Better Developer Experience:** IntelliSense, better debugging
- **Future Proof:** Microsoft's current direction
- **Less Code:** Eliminates `function.json` configuration files

### Migration Path
```python
# V2 Model - Clean and Modern
@app.route(route="images/upload", methods=["POST"])
def upload_image(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    # Implementation
```

### Consequences
